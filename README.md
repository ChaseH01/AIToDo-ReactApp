This full-stack To-Do List application allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal to-do items in a seamless and secure environment. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this app supports essential task operations like adding, editing, completing, and deleting to-do items.
ü§ñ OpenAI API is used to automatically summarize and enhance user task entries (optional feature).
üìß SendGrid (via Twilio) is used to automatically send a welcome email when a user signs up ‚Äî adding a professional touch to user onboarding.
üßæMongoDB is used to store user information acorss sessions

## How to run this code:
##### üßæ 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
Node.js (v18+ recommended): https://nodejs.org

##### 2. Clone the Repository
##### 3. Delete and Re-Install Dependencies
in ```./server```:
```
cd server
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
For the Frontend:
Open a second terminal tab or window and run:
```
cd to_do_app
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
##### üîê 4. Set Up API Keys
The server uses the OpenAI API, MongoDB, Twilio SendGrid, so you'll need a .env file.

In ```server/.env```, create this file with the following contents:
```
PORT=8080
MONGO_URI= ...
TWILIO_SENDGRID_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

##### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 5. Run the App
run ```npm start in /to_do_app```
run ```npm start in /server```
